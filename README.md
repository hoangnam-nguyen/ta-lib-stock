# Machine Learning for Stock Price Movement Prediction

This project explores the use of technical indicators and feature selection methods to improve stock price movement prediction using machine learning. The final model is implemented in a Jupyter notebook and tested on historical market data.

## 🔍 Project Objectives
- Extract and optimize technical indicators using TA-Lib
- Apply multiple feature selection methods to identify relevant predictors
- Train and evaluate machine learning models (e.g., MLP) for directional prediction
- Benchmark against naive and AR(1) models

## 📦 Dependencies
- Python
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
- TA-Lib
- matplotlib, seaborn

## 📈 Output
The notebook includes:
- Visualized indicator performance
- Selected features ranked by method
- Model evaluation (accuracy, RMSE, directional accuracy)
- Comparison with baseline strategies
